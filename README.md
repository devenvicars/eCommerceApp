# E-Commerce App Project
## A GreatStack Youtube tutorial.
<ul>
<li>This will be a project tutorial that I am following on YouTube. Tutorial can be found at https://youtu.be/7E6um7NGmeE?si=KIirXtqwEeBtzJWh .</li>
<li>Credit for the ideas and majority of the code goes to the creator of this video.</li> 
<li>Images will have sources provided in this README as images are added. *EDIT* Images are not sourced in video. I may potentially replace images to make this a more personal project</li>
  <li>The source code for this is behind a paywall, therefore all of the code was written by myself, following the video material. Many of the files are not supplied and shown in the video. Files such as the assets.js file had to be created from scratch using what is shown in the video and information gathered from various sources on the subject.</li>
